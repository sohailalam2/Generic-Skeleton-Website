templates/App.html is the primary container that has three sections :
    1. Header: This contains the navigation bar
    2. Container: This holds all the relevant information about the current page
    3. Footer: This contains the footer information

templates/App.html is first compiled and then inserted into the body tag of the index.html file.
After that the above three sections are inserted by compiling their individual templates.
