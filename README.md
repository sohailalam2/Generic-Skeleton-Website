# Generic Skeleton Website Project

As the name suggests, the Generic Skeleton Website is a skeleton website/webapp that can
be the base of any new starting web based project.

It makes heavy use of javascript **Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)** for the front end
development, following a **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern.
